classical magnetic fields in the NSR gernets experiment

Initial shared nsrB repository
Files:
1. nsr_Bdd.f: f77 Monte Carlo calculation of classical magnetic field averaged over volme 2 due to collection of individual dipoles in volume 1. Detector has cylindrical gravity mass with 8x the density of the substrate, and a symmetric cylindrical counterweight. Source has cylindrical gravity mass. Gap, amplitude, and detector length and width are read from external file; code will loop over varous values of these parameters, stored in each line of external file. Previous history of this code is summarized in the header.
4. big_G_W_phase.txt: sample ascii output file generated by big_G.f: 3 columns: source phase (rads), virtual work mean, virtual work error, for each oscillation of source mass.
5. big_G_inside_points.txt: sample ascii output file generated by big_G.f: x, y, z coordinates and mass indecies of individual points falling in test mass volumes, for use in 3D visualization of geometry for checking.
6. big_G_geom_check.nb: Mathematica notebook to make 3D plot of test masses and chech geometry
7. big_G_force_Fourier_amplitude: Mathematica notebook to convert the virtual work calculated by big_G.f to force, plot this value vs source mass phase for the first complete oscillation, compute the Fourier amplitude and error, and compare this value with that computed directly from the Monte Carlo.
